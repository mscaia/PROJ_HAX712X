## üõ†Ô∏è Code Snippet to Build the Website

Here are the steps to set up and deploy a Quarto-based website like the one we've created:

### 1. **Install Quarto**

Download and install Quarto from [quarto.org/download](https://quarto.org/download). Ensure that Quarto is added to your system's environment variables.

### 2. **Create a New Project**

Open your terminal and execute the following commands:

```bash
mkdir docs
cd docs
quarto create-project project_name --type website
```

### 3. **Add Content**

- Place `.qmd` files in the `docs/` folder to enrich your website's content.  
- Edit the `_quarto.yml` file to customize the site's structure and settings.

### 4. **Local Preview**

To preview the site locally, run the following command in the `./docs/` directory:

```bash
quarto preview
```

### 5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**

1. Go to the **GitHub Pages** section in your repository's settings.  
2. Under the **Build and Deployment** settings, select *Deploy from a branch*.  
3. Choose the `main` branch and the `/docs` folder as the source.  

Next, in the `./docs/` directory, run:

```bash
quarto render
```

Your site will be deployed on the next push to the `main` branch.
